LMS - LRR Modding System
========================

[**LMS**](http://www.rockraidersunited.org/topic/4079-lms) is a WIP unified modding system for _LEGOÂ® Rock Raiders_. It's going to be an all-purpose launcher, patcher/mod installer, wad manager, etc.
Written in Python, and frozen with py2exe for usability. Patchman scripts will be supported, and CFG mods will be managed with diff and patch. In the future, 
it may even play custom music with it in the background.
